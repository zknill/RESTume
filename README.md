# RESTum√©
Simple little RESTful API to serve my CV.
Heavily influenced by and based upon Matt Heath's Golang UK Conference talk.

## The vision
A REST API that exposes my CV for the world to see.

Built in go and heavily influenced by and based upon Matt Heath's Golang UK Conference talk.

## TODO
- Workout how service enpoints access service resources
- Add database integration, and a document serializer
- Add proper error handling and logging
- Move hardcoded data into the database
- Add support for more RESTful paths. e.g. /work/{job}/{detail}
