# RESTum√©
Simple little RESTful API to serve my CV.
Heavily influenced by and based upon [Matt Heath's Golang UK Conference talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFJkLfujOts).

## The vision
A REST API that exposes my CV for the world to see.

## TODO
- Consider how to properly test the more complex endpoints
- Add better database integration.
- Add support for more RESTful paths. e.g. /work/{job}/{detail}
- Add better tests
